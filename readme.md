CrystalDot is a simple Braille Signages generator with a graphical user interface.

The software utilizes [Liblouis](https://github.com/liblouis/liblouis) and [Geometry3Sharp](https://github.com/gradientspace/geometry3Sharp) to generate a STL file for 3d printing. Users can customize various parameters such as the signage and Braille dimensions according to their needs.

Developed as part of [Prowadnica Foundation's](https://prowadnica.org) mission, which is a polish organization for the blind, CrystalDot aims to simplify the process of creating Braille signages for non-expert users.

While we are using more complex, advanced OpenSCAD scripts internally, CrystalDot offers a straightforward solution for anyone looking to create Braille signages quickly and easily.
